[{"content":"Detecting exoplanets can be a challenging task because planets do not emit their own have nuclear energy sources. As a result, astronomers often rely on heavier and brighter stars to detect the presence of planets. Using telescopic data, astronomers analyze changes in the brightness of a star when a planet passes in front of it (known as a transit) or in frequency due to the Doppler effect caused by the star\u0026rsquo;s wobble around a common center of mass, or Barycenter, indicating the presence of one or more planets. This method has been instrumental in discovering thousands of exoplanets beyond our solar system, providing a glimpse into the diversity of planetary systems in the universe.\nFor the purpose of this article, we are going to find the orbital parameters of a particular planet - HD 86081 from radial velocity data of the corresponding star - HD 86081. The data is attained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. We have the data of the radial velocity of this star that has been calculated from the data of the Doppler’s shift. Of course, this radial velocity is not the original velocity of the star but a component along the axis of our telescope. This should also theoretically follow a periodic pattern. In figure 1, we have a scattered plot of our raw data of radial velocity of the star and at first glance, there does appear any pattern in the data. A noticeable aspect of the data is that there are some promi- nent intervals of time when no data is collected.\n","permalink":"https://absr.space/posts/exoplanet_detection/","summary":"Detecting exoplanets can be a challenging task because planets do not emit their own have nuclear energy sources.

My love for mathematics also began early on, especially when working with infinite series. More recently, I discovered my interest in computer programming while pursuing a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in computational physics and quantum mechanics.\nMy Masters thesis in physics focused on (auto-)correlation analysis of the wave function of interacting particles in a quartic double well, which helped me improve my numerical simulation and time-series analysis skills. I also worked as a project assistant at the Quantum and Nonlinear Dynamics Lab, where we recently studied the dynamics of a time-periodically driven quantum impact oscillator and found evidence of strange non-chaotic behavior in the wave function.\n","permalink":"https://absr.space/about/","summary":"I developed a passion for physics in high school when I learned about the relationship between electricity and magnetic fields.
